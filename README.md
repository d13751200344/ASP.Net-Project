# ASP.Net-Project
This website enables a photographer to promote services and the courses he can offer, and people can contact him through the information on the website. 

As a user who is not logged in, he/she can only browse home page, photos in albums (galleries), courses, and privacy page.

Logged-in customers can purchase courses by e-commerce system and can check their Cart and Orders.  

The administrator of the website can do all CRUD operations to all the contents, such as photos, galleries, and courses on the website, and he/she can access three more options in navigation bar than cutomers: "Galleries", 'All photos' under "Portfolios", and "All Orders".
In the photos details page for only administrator, he/she can see all information of every photo. In "All Orders", the administrator can see all the oders he/she received, and can check details of each orders.

The application enables users to use Google OAuth authentication as well.



As I don't have enough Azure credits, I don't deploy my project online. I run my project in local database environment in the presentation, and here is the presentation link:

Forgive me if I have to split the demo into two parts as there is a limit to the length of each video.
